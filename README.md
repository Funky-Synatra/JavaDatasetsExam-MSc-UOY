# Java Datasets Exam - Data Handling and Analysis (MSc)

This repository contains the source code for a Java project I created as part of an exam for my Masters program in Computer Science and AI. The focus is on demonstrating core Java skills for loading, processing, and analyzing datasets.

## Description

This project showcases my ability to:

*   **Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** Implement core classes to effectively model a Java solution.
*   **Perform Data Handling Operations:** Reads data from files using various Java tools and manipulate complex datasets into useful outputs.
*   **Coding Proficiency**: Successfully write algorithms using Java programming.
*  **Apply core elements of data analysis**: Gaining the low-level elements needed to make the code from ground zero.

Key concepts explored and used:

*  Load CSV Data.
*   Manipulate the information.
*   Produce a meaningful outcome and present the logic so that another user may inspect the dataset used to come to similar conclusions, improving testability and providing easy instrumentation points.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```
2.  **Compile the Code:** Compile the Java source files.
3.  **Execute:** Run the `Main.java` file from your terminal, specifying the directory containing the .csv's that should be examined for manipulation:

```bash
     java -cp "./apache-commons-csv-1.10.0.jar:." Main /directory/of/choice
